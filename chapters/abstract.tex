Image processing is used everywhere, from image editing to shaders requiring real-time performance. In this paper, an FPGA-based co-processor is presented, allowing $2 \times$ image processing speedup compared to a CPU-based algorithm. The results are only theoretical, as the hardware implementation was never fully realized due to time constraints.
