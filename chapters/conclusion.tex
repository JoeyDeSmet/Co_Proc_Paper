\section{Conclusion}

The coprocessor has the potential to significantly speed up image processing, but is currently limited by the AXI bus. AXI would be less limiting if there was more to do on the image data. This could all be improved by increasing data width and speed of the AXI bus, but beacause of lack of time and no working implementation, no further investigation was done for this.
